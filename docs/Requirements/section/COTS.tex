Android is a Linux-based operating system for mobile devices such as
smartphones and tablets. The application layer framework include
Java-compatible libraries, which allows developers to program Android
applications in Java, using the Android SDK. Therefore, we are bound to the
constraints that Java apply in general, as well as the Android Framework and
the hardware limitations of the physical devices.

\subsection{Touch Screen}
Although some Android devices have physical keyboards, most of them uses a
touch screen as their main input device. It is therefore important that any
interaction with the game must be designed and arranged in a manner that
supports the screen constraints. 

\subsection{Screen Resolution}
The screen resolution on Android devices vary greatly. To deal with this, we
will add images of different resolution. The Android compiler will
automatically compile images with the correct resolution, as long as they are
provided and correctly placed within the source code.

\subsection{Android device only}
The game will only run on Android mobile devices and Android emulators.

\subsection{Memory Constraints}
Mobile devices generally have a limited amount of memory. This will most likely
not be an issue, but still something we need to be aware of.

\subsection{Server performance}
Our server will be a lightweight server with limited resources. The amount of
concurrent connections the server may handle will be something we must take
notice of.
