ATAM is done as a risk-mitigation strategy, early in the software development
life cycle. The purpose of an ATAM session is to help choose a suitable
architecture for a software system by discovering trade-offs and sensitivity
points. 

The ATAM is done by an external expert team, to secure against biased results.
