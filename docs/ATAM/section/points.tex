\section{Sensitivity Points}

\begin{tabular}{|m{0.1 \textwidth}|m{0.8 \textwidth}|}
  \hline
  S1 & The sheep framework doesn't come with great documentation, which will
  affect the development process negatively \\ \hline
  S2 & Different screen sizes will complicate the development of the user
  interface when using touch input \\ \hline
