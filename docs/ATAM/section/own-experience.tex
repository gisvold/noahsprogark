\section{Own experience from using ATAM}
We started off, as it says in the ATAM overview, with recapping the phases of
the ATAM process. After this both groups presented their projects. Once the
projects had been presented, we started identifying the architectural
approaches of our opponent group.

Having finished this, the groups split up and made the utility tree and
analyzed the architectural approaches in their own time. Once this was finished
the groups reconvened to present their results. After this presentation, the
groups finalized their documentation.

As we are new to this ATAM process, we feel that we spent a lot of time on it
compared to what we got out of it. In addition we feel that this process may
be more suited for larger projects. We feel that the ATAM process provides a
good framework for architecture evaluation, and think it's good to have been
through it for the future.
