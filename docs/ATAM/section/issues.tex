Our opponent group lacked prioritization (importance) of their functional
requirements. They also lacked a description of their scenarios (they only had
the scenario tables), which made it difficult to understand the context, and
made it more difficult for our group to finish the report. Lastly their
response measures didn't contain specifics, only a general statement (for
instance ``cost in terms of time'' instead of a specific goal time for
implementation).

We did also have some problems with the ``architecture analysis'' where the
group didnt have have tactics related to the usability scenarios.
