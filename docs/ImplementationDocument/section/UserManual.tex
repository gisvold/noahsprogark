\subsubsection{Playing Bedres-bingo}
The main gameplay will be played on the Bingo Board shown below. The game
should be played in context of a ``Bedpres'' in order to be played properly.
The speaker will be the one presenting words. When a player hears a specific
word, the player presses the corresponding word on his/her device.

When a word is pressed, the cell with the word will turn green. The goal is to
cross off all the words in a row or column. The game is ultimately won by
crossing off all the words on the board.
