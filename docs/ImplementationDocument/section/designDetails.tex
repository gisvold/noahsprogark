\label{designdetails}

Some changes were done along the way in order to accomodate new ideas and solve issues that occured. The changes were of differing size and complexity, but we are in the opinion that our original architecture was a good fit for what we wanted to accomplish.

Listed below are the features we wish to highlight.
Each item will be described in detail in the follow subsection.
