\section{Problems, Issues and Points Learned}
\label{sec:issues}
The group encountered some issues regarding meeting hours. As each group
of the members has very busy scheduals, it was not easy to find a time where the group could have regular meetings where every member
had the opportunity to meet.\\

Another issue the group encountered
was in using the \texttt{Sheep.jar} package. \texttt{Sheep.jeg} is not
suitable for a game like ``Bedpres-Bingo'', as it doesn't require game-loops in the same way \texttt{Sheep.jar} provides.\\

In the end-phase of the implementation, an inertia was discovered in
fetching games from the server. This delay was between 3 and 10 seconds,
and was not desired for a game like ``Bedpres-Bingo'', as users may
experience the need for quick reconnection to the ongoing game. This was solved by removing the resolving of foreign keys, and resolving the words like a \texttt{String} separated with commas.
