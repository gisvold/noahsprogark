\section{Architectural rationale}
\label{sec:architecturalrationale}

We have chosen MVC, server-client and Singleton patterns in our application.

The MVC pattern was chosen in order to ensure a clean separation of interface
and logic. This helps increase modifiability and agrees with the COTS platform
way of implementation.

The Singleton pattern was chosen to allow for settings that are shared
throughout the different parts of the application.

We chose the client-server pattern in order to ensure the multiplayer
experience. P2P-pattern was another alternative, but we saw client-server as a
better option since we had more experience with this pattern.
