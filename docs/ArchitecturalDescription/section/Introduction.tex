This document describes the architecture of our Android game ``Bedpres-Bingo''.
The game is an augmented version of the popular board/gambling game Bingo,
with localized variations and rules. For those familiar with Bingo,
the game should be easy to start playing. Instead of numbers, this augmented
version will feature words instead. The goal of the game is to cross off
different words on your board. Words are crossed off when they are mentioned
during a company presentation at one of the line societies at NTNU, known in
norwegian as a ``bedriftspresentasjon'' or, colloquially, a ``bedpres''.

It is expected that the reader possesses an understanding of software
architecture. To fully understand and enjoy this game, the player should
possess a knowledge about what a ``bedpres'' is, and the game should be played
during one of these presentations. The conditions for winning are to cross off
all the words on the board, where these words typically are buzzwords used by
the companies that come to present themselves as a tool to get people to pay
attention.
