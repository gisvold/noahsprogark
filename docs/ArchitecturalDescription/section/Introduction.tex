The project is a part of the course ``Software Architecture (TDT4240)'' at NTNU. The goal is to create a multiplayer game running on a mobile device. We were free to choose between Android, iOS and XNA as target platform for our game. 
The project should cover all aspects of software development from documentation to implementation and testing. 

This document contains an architectural description of the planned implementation of our system.

It is expected that the reader possesses an understanding of software
architecture. To fully understand and enjoy this game, the player should
possess a knowledge about what a ``bedpres'' is, and the game should be played
during one of these presentations. The conditions for winning are to cross off
all the words on the board, where these words typically are buzzwords used by
the companies that come to present themselves as a tool to get people to pay
attention.
