\section{Architectural viewpoint selection} 
\label{architecturalviewpointselection}
%Finished

For this project we have chosen to use two primary architectural viewpoints and one secondary. 
The main viewpoints will be development viewpoint and the logic viewpoint. The secondary one will be the process viewpoint.

We have chosen to remove the physical viewpoint. Even though our game will run on different physical devices (there is 3 997 different fragmentations of devices running Android \cite{website:androidfragmentations}), all of the interaction with the hardware is abstracted by the JVM and the Android operating system.

\subsection{Logic View}
{\bf Purpose: } The logic view is concerned with the functionality that the system provides to end-users.
{\bf Stakeholders: } Players, developers, course staff and Abakus and Online.
{\bf Form of description: } Class diagram using 4+1 model description.

\subsection{Development View}
{\bf Purpose: } The development view illustrates a system from a programmers perspective and concerned with software management.
{\bf Stakeholders: } Developers, Course Staff.
{\bf Form of description: } Architecture layout diagram.

\subsection{Process View}
{\bf Purpose: } The process view deals with the dynamic aspect of the system, explains the system processes and how they communicate and focuses on the runtime behaviour of the system.
{\bf Stakeholders: } Players, Developers, Course Staff, Abakus and Online.
{\bf Form of description: } Process blueprint with standard notation.
