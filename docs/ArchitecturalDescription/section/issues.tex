We had some issues related to understanding the Sheep Framework. None of us
have any prior experience with it, and it took some time to understand what the
framework brought with it. 

On a later stage we decided to not use the Sheep Framework. Our game has very little graphical elements, and we have no moving objects. Due to this we see little advantage from using Sheep, and we decided it would be easier to not use it at all.

We had some issues with getting all the group members in the same room at the same time to work together. The five of us follow five different study programs, in addition to all of us being very engaged in Online or Abakus. This meant that it was difficult to find time for all of us to work at the same time. This lead to issues with communication.
