We had some issues related to understanding the Sheep Framework. None of us
have any prior experience with it, and it took some time to understand what the
framework brought with it. 

On a later stage we decided to not use the Sheep Framework. Our game has very little graphical elements, and we have no moving objects. Due to this we see little advantage from using Sheep, and we decided it would be easier to not use it at all.
