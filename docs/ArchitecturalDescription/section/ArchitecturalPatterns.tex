%TODO: What other patterns will we use?
We will be implementing our game using the Model-View-Controller pattern. 

In order to achieve the multiplayer experience, we will use the client server pattern. We will run a server which all the players will connect to. The server will host the game, and relay all necessary data between the different players. 
%TODO: Write something useful about theese patterns.

We plan to use the Sheep framework, however, we have not decided to what extend we want to use it. We will definitely be utilizing the layer functionality Sheep provides.
