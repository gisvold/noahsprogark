We will be implementing our game using the Model-View-Controller pattern.

The game settings will be shared by all game states by implementing the
Singleton pattern.

In order to achieve the multiplayer experience, we will use the client-server
pattern. We will run a server which all the players will connect to. The server
will host the game, and relay all necessary data between the different players.

We plan to use the Sheep framework. We have not, however, decided to what
extent we want to use it although it offers some useful abstractions for game
development.

The server will be implemented using the Model-view-controller pattern. Which
serverside technology we end up using is not completely determined, but Django
will most likely be our chosen web fremwork. Django appears to be a
MVC-framework where we mainly will manage the models and the views for data
handling and representation. The application will also contain a twist of
observer-observable pattern for the client to observe changes on the server.
